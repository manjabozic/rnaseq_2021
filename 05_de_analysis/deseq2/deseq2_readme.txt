Directory deseq2 containsR scripts for the entire DESeq2 workflow, as well as an R script to combine all the 
htseq count files, as well as coldata, containing metadata about the experiment. 

DESeq2 works only if you have biological replicates, so i made some fake ones and tried it out in fake_reps/.

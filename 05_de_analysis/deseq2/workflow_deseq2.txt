#Load DESeq into the workspace

library(DESeq2)

#since we are using htseq, we need to merge all the counts files into one first

#to do that, we will use an R script through the command line - htseq-combine_all.R

Rscript htseq-combine_all.R <arg1> <arg2>

#arg1 is the path to where the files are and arg2 is the name of the final output

Rscript htseq-combine_all.R ~/rnaseq_2021/04_read_counts/htseq/ counts





#then we can start preparing the files for the DESeq analysis

dds <- DESeqDataSetFromHTSeq(countData = counts, colData = coldata, design= ~ batch + condition)

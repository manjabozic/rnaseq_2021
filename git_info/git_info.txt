git config --global user.name "#username"
git config --global user.email "#user_mail"

#Creating a repository for all the files

git init

git status

#If there are untracked files Git will notify us in the git status

#To track them do:

git add #filename/pathtofilename

git commit -m "#a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why"

#we can see the history of all the changes

git log

#or the changes made, through all the differences

git diff

git diff --staged 
#all the changes to be commited
git diff HEAD #filename

git diff HEAD~1
#shows the change before the last one, and so on with ~2, ~3, etc

git diff #changeidentifier #filename
#see the exact change using the change identifier string or its shorter form


#we can also see all the changes with comments

git show HEAD #filename

#you can't add directories, but you can add al the files within one

git add #directory-with-files

#changing back - staged changes

git checkout HEAD/HEAD~1/HEAD~2 #filename

#changing back - commited changes
